# Database1
Final Database Project


Let's say, there is an event. This event is an educational event called  SQL Saturday. It is a database people meetup. It happens once a year at many given addresses/locations and driven by local user groups.
People who attend the meetup have different roles. Some are organizers, they keep track of submitted sessions, notify the presenters, and send all the info about meetup to “students” – who are in essence working professionals. They also solicit Sponsors/vendors.
 Presenters lecture. 
Vendors present software solutions and services and participate in the gift raffle at the end of the event. 
The “students” come to listen to the presentations, grade the presentations and they provide their emails to vendors in exchange for participation in a ruffle.
There are also volunteers that make the event happen along with the organizers.
 One person can be more than in one role during the event, for example, they can come in as both vendors and presenters.
Some presenters visit other presenter's classes as students.
There are multiple rooms and classes at a single venue address. 
“Class” is a content that presenter presents. It has a title, a description, a duration, and a difficulty level.
Each presenter can present more than one class at the event.
In preparation for the event, many presenters submit potential lectures and organizers choose among offerings organizing information in tracks.
Presenters can present the same class at many events in multiple locations.
There are tracks. Track is a logical collection of classes based on specific area in the database domain.  Examples are SQL Development, Administration, Architecture – etc. The classes are organized per track. The class has a topic and a duration.  Tracks usually happen in the same room, but it is not mandatory.
